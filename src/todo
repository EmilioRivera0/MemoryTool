change integer types to intN_t for exact sizes
check how to correctly iterate through the local buffer without reading any external address from the buffer (prevent operations on foreign addresses)
search through block of memory and get address
take in count long, unsigned
if necessary use limits.h and specify C version to compile the program with
write block of memory back
remember user to run program as root
verbose mode
ask user if he wants to choose the data type or let the program infer it
improve user input verification
modify code so only the modified bytes are written back into the remote process memory space

*
comment on MAPS_LINE_BUFFER size since it could not contain larger lines
memory sector viewer
access through executable name
execute program on a different buffer from the terminal one. And clear the previous printed content.
check if there is a way to optimize the search through the local buffer
